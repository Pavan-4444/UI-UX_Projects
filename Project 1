Food Delivery App UI/UX
This was my first UI/UX project, where I learned key design concepts such as wireframing, prototyping, color schemes, typography, and more. 
I gained these skills by watching YouTube tutorials, which helped me build a solid foundation in UI/UX design.

Description:
I created a wireframe and interactive prototype for a food delivery app, focusing on clean design, ease of use, and smooth user flow.
By applying UI/UX best practices, I aimed to enhance user engagement and streamline the ordering process.
