New School UI
This project showcases a modern interface designed in Figma. I focused on creating the 'New School UI' with a curated color palette and thoughtfully chosen typography.
The design emphasizes visual hierarchy and readability, enhancing user experience and overall functionality.
It is purely a UI design, and the final result is visually appealing, with a balanced use of colors and elements that make the interface stand out.
